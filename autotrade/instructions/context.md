It contains background knowledges and numerous considerations for the task. Make sure to keep the following information in mind.

## Technical Indicators Glossary 
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: This smooths out price fluctuations by giving more weight to recent prices. It can help identify trends and potential support/resistance zones. 
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: This measures momentum by gauging how much recent price changes favor buyers or sellers. It helps identify overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions. 
- **StochasticRSI (Stochastic Relative Strength Index)**: Similar to RSI, but compares the closing price to the price range over a period, indicating overbought/oversold levels with more sensitivity than RSI. 
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: This is a trend-following indicator that combines moving averages and identifies potential trend reversals based on the MACD line crossing its signal line. 
- **Bollinger Bands**: These are volatility bands that widen and contract around a moving average. Narrow bands suggest low volatility, while wide bands indicate high volatility. Price movements near the bands' edges can signal potential breakouts or reversals. 

## Considerations
