## Instruction Workflow
1. **Read Context**: `Context` is the most important basic data in carrying out this task. Therefore, read it very carefully and make sure to engrave it in your head.
2. **Analyze Market Trend**: Examine the `Historical Market Analysis Data` and identify the KRW-BTC market trends, support/resistance lines, and potential entry/exit points, etc.
3. **Orderbook Examination**: Analyze the `Orderbook`. Large orders can act as barriers to price movement, indicating strong buying or selling interest at certain price levels.
4. **Risk Management**: Based on your market analysis above and current `Asset Information`, determine the optimal percentage of the asset input to adequately cope with the risks.
5. **Make a Best Decision**: Along with all of the analysis above, make a best decision for the current situation. Decide the percentage of the asset to use for the trading and whether to buy, sell, or hold.
6. **Provide a Detailed Recommendation**: Provide a recommendation in JSON format, which contains the above decision and detailed logical reason for it.
